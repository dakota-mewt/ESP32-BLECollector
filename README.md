------------

BLECollector is just a passive BLE scanner with a fancy UI.
All BLE data found by the BLE Scanner is collected into a [sqlite3](https://github.com/siara-cc/esp32_arduino_sqlite3_lib) format on the SD Card.

Public Mac addresses are compared against [OUI list](https://code.wireshark.org/review/gitweb?p=wireshark.git;a=blob_plain;f=manuf), while Vendor names are compared against [BLE Device list](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/company-identifiers).

Those two database files are provided in a db format ([mac-oui-light.db](https://github.com/tobozo/ESP32-BLECollector/blob/master/SD/mac-oui-light.db) and [ble-oui.db](https://github.com/tobozo/ESP32-BLECollector/blob/master/SD/ble-oui.db)).

On first run, a default `blemacs.db` file is created, this is where BLE data will be stored.
When a BLE device is found by the scanner, it is populated with the matching oui/vendor name (if any) and eventually inserted in the `blemasc.db` file.

‚ö†Ô∏è This sketch is big! Use the "No OTA (Large Apps)" or "Minimal SPIFFS (Large APPS with OTA)" partition scheme to compile it.
The memory cost of using sqlite and BLE libraries is quite high.

‚ö†Ô∏è Builds using ESP32-Wrover can eventually choose the 3.6MB SPIFFS partition scheme, and have the BLECollector working without the SD Card. Experimental support only since SPIFFS tends to get slower and buggy when the partition becomes full.

Software requirements (updated)
---------------------
  - [mandatory] Arduino IDE
  - [mandatory] [ESP32-Chimera-Core](https://github.com/tobozo/ESP32-Chimera-Core/) (get it from the Arduino Library Manager)

  - [mandatory] [NimBLE Library](https://github.com/h2zero/NimBLE-Arduino/archive/master.zip) supersedes the BLE (legacy or custom) library versions, install it manually in the Arduino/Libraries folder.
  - [mandatory] [PaulStoffregen's Time library](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Time) (get it from the Arduino Library Manager)
  - [mandatory] [esp32_arduino_sqlite3_lib](https://github.com/siara-cc/esp32_arduino_sqlite3_lib) (get it from the Arduino Library Manager)
  - [optional] [TinyGPSPlus](https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus)

Behaviours (auto-selected except for WiFi):
---------------------------
  - **Hobo**: when no TinyRTC module exists in your build, only uptime will be displayed
  - **Rogue**: TinyRTC module adjusted after flashing (build DateTime), shares time over BLE
  - **Chronomaniac**: TinyRTC module adjusts itself via GPS, shares time over BLE
  - **With WiFi**: Temporary dual BLE/WiFi mode to allow downloading or serving .db files, see `#define WITH_WIFI` in `Settings.h`

Optional I2C RTC Module requirements
------------------------------------
  - Wire your TinyRTC to RTC_SDA/RTC_SCL (see `Settings.h` or `Display.h` to override)
  - Insert the SD Card
  - Set `#define HAS_EXTERNAL_RTC true` in [Settings.h](https://github.com/tobozo/ESP32-BLECollector/blob/master/Settings.h)
  - Flash the ESP with partition scheme `Minimal SPIFFS (Large APPS with OTA)`

Optional Serial GPS Module requirements
---------------------------------------
  - Wire your GPS module to TX1/RX1 (edit `GPS_RX` and `GPS_TX` in GPS.h
  - Set `#define HAS_GPS true` in [Settings.h](https://github.com/tobozo/ESP32-BLECollector/blob/master/Settings.h)
  - Flash the ESP with partition scheme `Minimal SPIFFS (Large APPS with OTA)`
  - Wait for the GPS to find a fix
  - issue the command `gpstime` in the serial console

Optional XPad Buttons Shield requirements
-----------------------------------------
  - Wire your XPad Buttons Shield to XPAD_SDA/XPAD_SCL  (see `HID_XPad.h` to override)
  - Enable the module in `Display.h` : `#define hasXPaxShield() (bool) true`
  - Controls are:
    - Down / Up : brightness
    - Right / Left : unassigned (yet)
    - A : start/stop scan
    - B / C : toggle mac filter
    - D : unassigned (yet)

Time Sharing
------------
  - Once the time is set using RTC, GPS or NTP, the BLECollector may start the TimeSharing service and advertise a DateTime characteristic for other BLECollectors to sync with.
  - Builds with no RTC/GPS will try to identify this service during their scan duty cycle and subscribe for notifications.

File Downloading (still experimental)
------------

Sending the `DownloadDB` command will:

  - Stop BLE
  - Start WiFi
  - Synchronize time to a nearby NTP server
  - Download the latest oui/vendors¬†database from github

Known issues / Roadmap
----------------------

Implementing both [LovyanGFX](https://github.com/lovyan03/LovyanGFX) and [Nimble-Arduino](https://github.com/h2zero/NimBLE-Arduino) was such a huge optimization that none of the previous blockers exist any more!

Some ideas I'll try to implement in the upcoming changes:

- Add GPS Coords to entries for better pruning [as suggested by /u/playaspect](https://www.reddit.com/r/esp8266/comments/9s594c/esp32blecollector_ble_scanner_data_persistence_on/e8nipr6/?context=3)
- Better Analysis of ServiceData (see @reelyactive's [advlib](https://github.com/reelyactive/advlib))
- Extended logging (SDCard-less meshed builds)
